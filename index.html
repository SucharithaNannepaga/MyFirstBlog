<h2 align="justify">Defnition:artificial intelligence (AI), the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings.<br/>Today, the term “AI” describes a wide range of technologies that power many of the services and goods we use every day from apps that recommend tv shows to chatbots that provide customer support in real time. </h2>

<h3>what is artificial intelligence(AI)?</h3>
<h4 align="justify">Artificial intelligence (AI) is the theory and development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that historically required human intelligence, such as recognizing speech, making decisions, and identifying patterns. AI is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of technologies, including machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing (NLP). <br/>

  Although the term is commonly used to describe a range of different technologies in use today, many disagree on whether these actually constitute artificial intelligence. Instead, some argue that much of the technology used in the real world today actually constitutes highly advanced machine learning that is simply a first step towards true artificial intelligence, or “general artificialintelligence” (GAI).<br/>Yet, despite the many philosophical disagreements over whether “true” intelligent machines actually exist, when most people use the term AI today,they are referring to a suite of machine learning-powered technologies, such as Chat GPT or computer vision, that enable machines to perform tasks that previously only humans can do like generating written content, steering a car, or analyzing data. </h4>

  <h3>Mchine Learning</h3>
  <h4 align="justify">Machine learning (ML) is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalize to unseen data and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions. Recently, artificial neural networks have been able to surpass many previous approaches in performance.<br/>Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science that focuses on the using data and algorithms to enable AI to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.Data is a crucial component in the field of Machine Learning. It refers to the set of observations or measurements that can be used to train a machine-learning model.The quality and quantity of data available for training and testing play a significant role in determining the performance of a machine-learning model. Data can be in various forms such as numerical, categorical, or time-series data, and can come from various sources such as databases, spreadsheets, or APIs. Machine learning algorithms use data to learn patterns and relationships between input variables and target outputs, which can then be used for prediction or classification tasks.<br/>
   Data is typically divided into two types: </h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Labled data</li>
      <li>unlabeled data</li>
    </ol>

  <h3>Natural language processing</h3>
  <h4>The meaning of NLP is Natural Language Processing (NLP) which is a fascinating and rapidly evolving field that intersects computer science, artificial intelligence, and linguistics. NLP focuses on the interaction between computers and human language, enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is both meaningful and useful. With the increasing volume of text data generated every day, from social media posts to research articles, NLP has become an essential tool for extracting valuable insights and automating various tasks.</h4>
  <h4><abbr title="Natural Language Processing">NLP</abbr> Techniques are:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Text Processing and Preprocessing In NLP</li>

  <h3>Deep Learning</h3>
  <h4>Deep Learning stands as a cornerstone technology, revolutionizing how machines understand, learn, and interact with complex data. At its essence, Deep Learning AI mimics the intricate neural networks of the human brain, enabling computers to autonomously discover patterns and make decisions from vast amounts of unstructured data. This transformative field has propelled breakthroughs across various domains, from computer vision and natural language processing to healthcare diagnostics and autonomous driving.<br/>it is the branch of machine learning that is based on artificial neural network architecture. An artificial neural network or ANN uses layers of interconnected nodes called neurons that work together to process and learn from the input data.</h4>
  <h4><abbr title="Deep Learning">DL</abbr>Techniques are:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Deep neural networks</li>
    <li>Convolution neural networks(CNN)</li>
